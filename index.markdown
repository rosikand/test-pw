I am interested in AI research, ML engineering, startups, and venture capital.

In the past, I've conducted research in self-supervised learning at SAIL, engineered segmentation models at insitro, and built many ML projects.

See my [portfolio](./portfolio) page here for past projects and experiences.

I also infrequently write about startups and venture capital on Substack at Rohan's Random Walks.

In my free time, I play golf and think.
